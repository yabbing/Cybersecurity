Create a `.json` file with this structure:

```json
{
  "name": "🎯 Your Methodology Name",
  "description": "Brief description here",
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "unique-id-1",
      "text": "Task description",
      "category": "Category Name"
    },
    {
      "id": "unique-id-2",
      "text": "Another task",
      "category": "Category Name"
    }
  ],
  "hints": [
    "💡 Helpful hint 1",

```
